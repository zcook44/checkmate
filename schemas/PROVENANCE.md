The upstream ZIP contains only the JSON file and no license or redistribution notice. This file is third-party DISA material, **not covered by this repository's license**. Its presence in this private repository does not establish permission to redistribute it publicly. Confirm the applicable terms with your organization before distributing a release beyond authorized recipients. A SHA-256 comparison verifies byte identity, not publisher authentication; obtain the expected value through an independently trusted channel.

Checkmate still requires explicit `--schema schemas/SV3_CKLB_1_0_JSON_SCHEMA.json` for validation. `--validate --schema ...` checks selected newest CKLBs without editing them; editor mode with `--schema` validates selected files before writing. `--list` does not validate schema and cannot be combined with these flags. No schema is silently applied. A different operator-supplied Draft 2019-09 JSON schema is accepted if it compiles, but is not DISA validation; the CLI does not pin the supplied file's hash. The generic amd64/arm64 archives carry this JSON and notice, not the upstream ZIP or official benchmark XML. The separate converter repository's copy and optional offline preflight are outside Checkmate's build and test boundary.
